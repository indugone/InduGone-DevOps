Maven:


Maven is a tool that is used to compile, validate codes and analyse the test cases in the code.
*manage the building reporting and documentation from source control managment (scm)
* maven projects are configured through project object model(pom)
*pom.xml file contains documentation for all the objects,properties, methods and events,


WHAT MAVEN IS CAPABLE OF?

*Information of project is centralized through maven.
*Our software project is modeled by it 
*Build procrss is managed 
*Data about the software and our project 
*Deployable artifacts can be generated from source code
*your source code is complied, packed, test and distributed
*Reports is created, website is generated for the project

MAVEN BUILD LIFECYLE:
===================

* In maven, the build run is using a predefined and orderd set of steps to call the build life cylcle.
*The build tasks that will be performed during each phase are determined by the confuguration in the project file, and in particular the selected packaging 
*Maven relies on build lifecycles to define the process of building and distributed artifacts
EX:(jarfilels, warfilels)
THERE ARE THREE  BUILT IN BUILD LIFECYCLES:
--DEFAULT - handles project building and deployment
--CLEAN   - handles project cleaning
--SITE    - handles project site generation

MAVEN ARCHITECTURE:
==================

plugin     plugin2  plugin3 plugin4

 ----------------------------------- 
           core
------------------------------------

 remote                  local 
repository            repository

* local repository refering to windows local mechine.
* remore repository refering to organization.


MAVEN ARTIFACTS:
===============
*An artifact is a file resulting from packing a project
*can be a jar, war, ear, .xmlfile, for example
*Artifacts are deployed in repostories so they can be used as dependencies by other projects.
*Artifacts are identified by three components
*Groupid-- An unique identifer for a group of relatede artifacts usually  named like java packages(ex: pt.jpereia.mobile)
*Artifacts--An unique identifier, within the context of groupid that identifies the artifacts(project)
ex:puzzule
*Version--Also called artifact coordinates


MAVEN REPOSITORY FLOW:
=====================

------------
Remote
repository
------------
                  step2

                               ----------
  step3                             DEVELOPER
                              -----------    
                 step1
                 step4       
------------
Local 
Repository
-------------  

STEP1 : When developer executes mvn command it will go and checkin local repository.If found the dependencies are plugin the local repo developer will see the output.
STEP2 : If not founding local repository from developer mechines and it will go and search in remote repository
STEP3 : from remote repository required dependencies or pulgin will get store in local repository
STEP4 : From local repository developer will get the output.

INTERVIEW QUESTUIN:
For the first time when we execute mvn command it will take more time, but when we execute for the second time it will take less time because the repository dependencies is already stored in local repostion.

PROJECT OBJECT MODELS:
=====================
*Pom for short
*xml.file located at the root of the project (pom.xml)
*It includes configuration for uour project including :
-Information about the project
-configuration details to about the project 
-contains default values for most of the projects
Ex: source, dir, target div
-dependencies of the project
-configuration about plugins and goals
-used repositories
** DECLARING DEPENDENCIES:
   =======================            
* While declaring the dependencies coordinats of the artifacts must be provided
* GroupID: a unique identifier for the group of related artifact
*ARTIFACTID : An artifact is a file which is made after packaging a project and Artifactid is a unique identifier within the context of groupid and it is identifies the artifacts
VERSION: It is an identifier for the release or build number of project.
