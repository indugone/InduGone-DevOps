DOMAIN CONTROLLER AND HOST CONTROLLER INJOBSS IN WILDFLY:
========================================================

   In jboss wildfly a "domain controller" is the central management point for a group of servers within a domain, responsible for maintaining the overall configuration and policy, while a "host controller" is a separate process running on each server within the domain communicating with the domain controller to manage the individual server instancaes on that host controllers execute those configuration on their respective servers.

KEY POINTS ABOUT DOMAIN AND HOST CONTROLLERS DOMAIN CONTROLLER:=
================================================================
DOMAIN CONTROLLER:
=================

1.Acts as the central management point for the entire domain
2.stores the domain wide configuration in a file called "domain.xml"
(Home folder-->Domain--configuration--domain-domain.xml)
3.Resposible for distributing configuration changes to all host controllers within the domain.

HOST CONTROLLER:
==============

1.Manages the application server instances running on a specific host
2.Reads its configuration from a "host.xl" file specific to that host
(Home folder--Domain--configuration--host.xml)
3.Communicates with the domain controller to receive configuration updates and start/stop server instances.
"Domain is refers to master or centralized where we can manage other wildfly servers"(host)
