--IMPORTANCE OF CONTINOUS AND IMPORTANCE OF CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION:
-=================================================================

1) IMPROVES QUALITY: Improves the quality the running multiple unit task and anything various static code.

2)PRODUCTIVITY: Automatically build of code saves a lot of time here by increasing productivity.

3)REDUCES RISK: Eliminate the risk of potential human errors by increasing productivity.

INTRODUCTION TO JENKINS:
=======================

* Features of the Jenkins.
* Easy integration security
* Upgrades are easily available
* Provides advance security
* Optimized performance
* Distributed team management

WHAT IS CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION:
=============================

It is the process of automating the building and testing of code, each time one of the team member commits changes to version control.
*CI/CD -continuous integration and continuous deployment/delivery (release)

                            commit
                            ------->source control-------

1) Continuous integration
2) Continuous release (building artifacts)
3) Continuous Deployment (placing the artifacts in to webserver)


*POPULAR CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION TOOLS:-
=====================================
1) Gitlab
2) Codeship  
3) Bamboo
4) Jenkins
5) Trais CI

from aws cloud if we wanted to perform ci/cd, there are various like, code commit, code deploy, and codguru code pipeline, code build.
*from azure cloud we have devops azure boards repos. Azure pipeline, azure test plans, then azure artifacts.

WHAT IS JENLKINS:-
===============

* "A continuous integration server, (or) automation server which manages and control processes such as plan, code, build, test, deploy, operates and monitor in devops environment"

* Why we need plugins: To have extra functionality (developed by developers)

*PLUGINS MANAGEMENT IN JENKINS:-
==============================
         
        |------>UPADATE----shows updates for plugins already installed
        | 
        |------>AVAILABLE---shows plugins that are available for installation   
        |
TEST----|------>INSTALLED---deploys plugins installed that have no operates
        |
        |------>ADVANDED---lists configuration of HTTP proxy, allows manual upload of plugin and URL of plugin site
* In real time we cannot install the plugins as simple as that reason being they might be challenges with proxy as well as VPN(virtual private network) in order to avoid we should configure http proxy in Jenkins plugin of advanced tag.
