1. What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that is used to track changes in source code during software development. It permits multiple developers to work on a project together without interrupting each other's changes. Git is especially popular for its speed, and ability to manage both small and large projects capably
A Git repository (or repo) is like a file structure that stores all the files for a project. It continues track changes made to these files over time, helping teams work together evenly. Git can control both local repositories (on your own machine) and remote repositories (usually hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket), allowing teamwork and backup.
 What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git

GitHub

Git is a version control system used to track changes in files over time

GitHub is a platform where Git repositories can be stored and shared

 Git It runs locally on your computer

 GitHub It is a cloud-based service

Git can be used offline, as it operates locally on your machine.

GitHub requires an internet connection because it is hosted on the web
 What is origin in Git?
In Git, "origin" states to the default name offered to the remote repository from which local repository was cloned. It is used as a reference to control fetches, pulls, and pushes.
5. What is the purpose of the .gitignore file?
The '.gitignore' file tells Git which files and folders to ignore when tracking changes. It is used to avoid attaching unneeded files (like logs, temporary files, or compiled code) to your repository. This saves repository clean and targeted on important files only.
What is a version control system (VCS)?
A version control system (VCS) records the work of developers coordinating on projects. It keeps the history of code changes, permitting developers to add new code, fix bugs, and run tests securely. If required, they can restore a past working version, verifying project security.
7. What is the git push command?
The 'git push' command is used to share local repository changes to a remote repository. It changes the remote repository with the recent commits from the fixed local branch.

. What is the git pull command?
The 'git pull' command updates the current local branch with changes from a remote repository and combining it with a local repository.
What does git clone do?
The 'git clone' forms a copy of a remote repository upon your local machine. It downloads all files, branches, and history, enabling you to start working on the project or contribute to it. With git clone -b , you can download and work on an individual branch of a repository.

What are the advantages of using GIT?
Using Git provides multiple advantages:

It assists teamwork by supporting multiple developers to work on the same project together.
Each developer has a local copy of the repository, improving performance and enabling offline work.
Free and widely supported.
Git supports work on various types of projects.
Each repository has only one Git directory.
 What is the difference between git init and git clone?
'git init' develops a new, empty Git repository in the present directory, while 'git clone' copies an existing remote repository, containing all files and history, to a local directory.
What is git add?
The 'git add' command marks changes in your project for the next commit. It tells Git which files to involve in the later update, making them ready to be saved in the repository. This is the early step in recording changes in the Git repository.
What is git status?
The 'git status' command shows the recent status of your Git repository. It tells you which files have changed, which ones are ready to be committed, and which ones are new and unobserved. This benefits you monitor your work's growth and see what changes want to be set up or committed.

 What is the meaning of “Index” in GIT?
In Git, the "Index" (also called as the "Staging Area") is a place where alterations are temporarily store before committing them to the repository. It permits you to select and prepare specific alterations from your working directory before properly saving them as part of the project's history.

What differentiates between the commands git remote and git clone?
'git clone' : Downloads a full copy of a remote repository to your local computer, involving all files and history.

'git remote' : Controls connections to remote repositories. It sets up links to remote repositories but doesn't download any files.
. What is git stash?
Git stash is Git command used to temporarily store changes in your working directory that are not yet ready to be committed. It permits developers to conserve modifications without committing them to the repository.
What is the HEAD in Git?
In Git, HEAD is a source to the current branch or commit you are working on. HEAD normally shows the recent commit of the current branch and moves when you switch branches or check out exact commits.
What is the function of the git cherry-pick command?
The git cherry-pick command uses exact commits from one branch to another, allowing selective merging of changes without merging entire branches.
